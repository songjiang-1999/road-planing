# road-planing
This code implements path planning for the off-road environment, and generates three paths, the shortest path, the shortest time-consuming path, and the least uncertain path. The shortest uncertainty path considerations are the slope, roughness, and step elevation difference. The code imports map data and generates a path plan when run.
